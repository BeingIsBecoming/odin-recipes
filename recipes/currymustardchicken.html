    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><a>This recipe was given to me by a friend’s mother about 10 years ago and I have been using is ever since. With only 4 ingredients, this marinade is simple for anyone to make, and can really be used for a variety of different meats.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <p><ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>2-4 Teaspoons Curry Powder</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mustard and curry powder. (I use 4 tsp of curry powder because I like spice, however if you’re not a huge fan of spice you can use 2 tsp. curry powder or omit it all together.)</li>
        <li>Arrange chicken in a baking or casserole dish, and season lightly with a pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture over chicken and allow to marinade 1-2 hours. You can also cook it right away, but the flavours blend together better after sitting for a little while in my opinion.</li>
    </ol></p>
